# Variation Normalization
Services and guidelines for normalizing variation terms into [VRS (v1.1.1)](https://vrs.ga4gh.org/en/1.1.1) and [VRSATILE (latest)](https://vrsatile.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) compatible representations.

Public OpenAPI endpoint: https://normalize.cancervariants.org/variation

## About
Variation Normalization works by using four main steps: tokenization, classification, validation, and translation. During tokenization, we split strings on whitespace and parse to determine the type of token. During classification, we specify the order of tokens a classification can have. We then do validation checks such as ensuring references for a nucleotide or amino acid matches the expected value and validating a position exists on the given transcript. During translation, we return a VRS Allele object.

Variation Normalization is limited to substitution, deletion, insertion, and deletion-insertion variants located on p., c., and g. coordinates. We also support HGVS representations and text representation (ex: `BRAF V600E`). We are working towards adding more types of variants, coordinates, and representations.

### Endpoints
#### /toVRS
The `/toVRS` endpoint returns a list of valid [Alleles](https://vrs.ga4gh.org/en/1.1.1/terms_and_model.html#allele).

#### /normalize
The `/normalize` endpoint returns a [Variation Descriptor](https://vrsatile.readthedocs.io/en/latest/value_object_descriptor/vod_index.html#variation-descriptor) containing the MANE Transcript, if one is found.

## Backend Services
Variation Normalization relies on some local data caches which you will need to set up. It uses pipenv to manage its environment, which you will also need to install.

### Installation
#### Installing with pip
```commandline
pip install variation-normalizer
```

Variation Normalization relies on [seqrepo](https://github.com/biocommons/biocommons.seqrepo), which you must download yourself.

From the _root_ directory:
```
pipenv shell
pipenv lock
pipenv sync
cd variation
pip install seqrepo
mkdir -p data/seqrepo
seqrepo -r data/seqrepo pull -i 2021-01-29
sudo chmod -R u+w data/seqrepo
cd data/seqrepo
seqrepo_date_dir=$(ls -d */)
sudo mv $seqrepo_date_dir latest
```

Variation Normalizer also uses [uta](https://github.com/biocommons/uta).

_The following commands will likely need modification appropriate for the installation environment._
1. Install [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
2. Create user and database.

    ```
    $ createuser -U postgres uta_admin
    $ createuser -U postgres anonymous
    $ createdb -U postgres -O uta_admin uta
    ```

3. To install locally, from the _variation/data_ directory:
```
export UTA_VERSION=uta_20210129.pgd.gz
curl -O http://dl.biocommons.org/uta/$UTA_VERSION
gzip -cdq ${UTA_VERSION} | grep -v "^REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW" | psql -h localhost -U uta_admin --echo-errors --single-transaction -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -d uta -p 5433
```

To connect to the UTA database, you can use the default url (`postgresql://uta_admin@localhost:5433/uta/uta_20210129`). If you use the default url, you must either set the password using environment variable `UTA_PASSWORD` or setting the parameter `db_pwd` in the UTA class.

If you do not wish to use the default, you must set the environment variable `UTA_DB_URL` which has the format of `driver://user:pass@host/database/schema`.

### Data
Variation Normalization uses [Ensembl BioMart](http://www.ensembl.org/biomart/martview) to retrieve `variation/data/transcript_mappings.tsv`. We currently use `Human Genes (GRCh38.p13)` for the dataset and the following attributes we use are: Gene stable ID, Gene stable ID version, Transcript stable ID, Transcript stable ID version, Protein stable ID, Protein stable ID version, RefSeq match transcript (MANE Select), Gene name.

### Setting up Gene Normalizer
Variation Normalization `normalize` endpoint relies on data from [Gene Normalization](https://github.com/cancervariants/gene-normalization. You must have Gene Normalization's DynamoDB running for the `normalizer` endpoint to work.

To setup, follow the instructions from the [README](https://github.com/cancervariants/gene-normalization/blob/main/README.md). 

### Init coding style tests
Code style is managed by [flake8](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8) and checked prior to commit.

We use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#usage) to run conformance tests.

This ensures:

* Check code style
* Check for added large files
* Detect AWS Credentials
* Detect Private Key

Before first commit run:

```
pre-commit install
```

### Testing
From the _root_ directory of the repository:
```
pytest tests/
```

### Starting the Variation Normalization Service Locally
`gene-normalizer`s dynamodb must be running and run the following:
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up
```

From the _root_ directory of the repository:
```
uvicorn variation.main:app --reload
```
